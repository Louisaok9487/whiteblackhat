📖 About The Game
Project Gray-Fox is a single-player simulation game that runs entirely in your browser. You'll take on missions, choose your path as a white-hat or black-hat hacker, manage your resources, and see the consequences of your actions in a dynamic world. The primary goal is educational: to introduce players to a wide range of hacking techniques and cybersecurity principles without requiring any prior technical experience.

Description

📚 23 Unique Scenarios

Take on over 20 distinct missions, each designed to teach a specific concept, from SQL injections and social engineering to advanced ransomware and cloud security audits.

⚖️ Moral Choice System

Decide your path: White Hat hero or Black Hat legend? Your choices directly impact your reputation, mission offers, and the final outcome of your story.

🌍 Dynamic Game World

Your actions have consequences! Successful hacks and reported vulnerabilities appear in the dynamic news feed, showing your impact on the game's world.

💻 Resource Management

Keep an eye on your system's CPU and RAM. Running powerful tools requires significant resources, which can be upgraded in the shop.

🛠️ Persistent Upgrades

Use your earnings to buy new hacking tools (like Metasploit, John the Ripper), upgrade your hardware, and customize your terminal's appearance with different themes.

🎬 Multiple Endings

Based on your final reputation and "Heat" level, the game concludes with one of several unique endings. Will you retire rich, become a famous consultant, or get busted?

🕹️ How to Play
Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

Read your mail: Start by typing the mail command to receive your first mission.

Follow the hints: Each mission and task will provide clear guidance on which command to use next. The goal is to learn, not to get stuck.

Use your tools: As you progress, you'll use commands like nmap, metasploit, and social_eng to complete your objectives.

Make choices: Decide whether to report a vulnerability (White Hat) or exploit_data (Black Hat) to shape your story.

Manage your career: Use the shop to upgrade your gear and the abort mission command if a job is too hot.

🛠️ Technology
This game is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external libraries or frameworks required. It's designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy to run locally.
